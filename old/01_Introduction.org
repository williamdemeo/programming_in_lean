  :CUSTOM_ID: Introduction
:END:

/Warning./ This book is still under construction. It aims to serve as
both an introduction and a reference manual for programming in the
Lean theorem prover.

We are making this material public now because currently it is the
only existing documentation for many of the specifics of the Lean
programming language and its API, and we are hoping that the
information will be useful to brave souls experimenting with it at
this early stage. Most of the chapters are currently only stubs, but
comments and feedback on the material that is available will be
helpful.

** Lean as a Programming Language

This book can be viewed as a companion to [[https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/][Theorem Proving in Lean]],
which presents Lean as a system for building mathematical libraries
and stating and proving mathematical theorems.  From that perspective,
the point of Lean is to implement a formal axiomatic framework in
which one can define mathematical objects and reason about them.

As noted in that book, however, expressions in Lean have a
computational interpretation, which is to say, they can be
/evaluated/. As long as it is defined in the computational fragment of
Lean's foundational language, any closed term of type =nat= -- that
is, any term of type =nat= without free variables -- evaluates to a
numeral. Similarly, any closed term of type =list nat= evaluates to a
list of numerals, and any closed term of type =bool= evaluates
either to the boolean value =tt=, for "true," or =ff=, for "false."

This provides another perspective on Lean: instead of thinking of it
as a theorem prover whose language just happens to have a
computational interpretation, think of it as a programming language
that just happens to come equipped with a rich specification language
and an interactive environment for proving that programs meet their
specifications. The specification language and proof system are quite
powerful, rich enough, in fact, to include all conventional
mathematics.

We will see that Lean's underlying logical framework, the Calculus of
Inductive Constructions, constitutes a surprisingly good programming
language. It is expressive enough to define all sorts of data
structures, and it supports powerful abstractions. Programs written in
the language can be evaluated efficiently by Lean's virtual-machine
interpreter or translated automatically to C++ and compiled.

Viewed from a computational perspective, the Calculus of Inductive
Constructions is an instance of a purely functional programming
language. This means that a program in Lean is simply an expression
whose value is determined compositionally from the values of the other
expressions it refers to, independent of any sort of ambient state of
computation. There is no notion of storing a result in memory or
changing the value of a global variable; computation is just
evaluation of expressions. This paradigm makes it easier to reason
about programs and verify their correctness. At the same time, we will
see that Lean incorporates concepts and abstractions that make it
feasible to use this paradigm in practice.

The underlying foundational framework imposes one restriction that is
alien to most programming languages, namely, that every program is
terminating. So, for example, every "while" loop has to be explicitly
bounded, though, of course, we can consider the result of iterating an
arbitrary computation =n= times for any given natural number =n=. We
will see that Lean provides flexible mechanisms for structural and
well-founded recursion, allowing us to define functions in natural
ways. At the same, the system provides complementary mechanisms for
proving claims, using inductive principles that capture the structure
of the function definitions.

** Examples

For example...

[Define something like factorial. Evaluate (use both =reduce= and =eval=).]

[Define operations on lists.]

[Prove things, like ~length (reverse l) = length l~ or ~reverse
(reverse l) = l~.]

** Input and Output

People often want to write programs that interact with the outside
world, querying users for input and presenting them with output during
the course of a computation. Lean's foundational framework has no
model of "the real world," but Lean declares =get_str= and =put_str=
commands to get an input string from the user and write an input
string to output, respectively. Within the foundational system, these
are treated as black box operations. But when programs are evaluated
by Lean's virtual machine or when they are translated to C++, they
have the expected behavior. Here, for example, is a program that
prints "hello world":
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import system.io
variable [io.interface]
open io

def hello_world : io unit :=
put_str "hello world\n"

#eval hello_world
#+END_SRC
The next example prints the first 100 squares:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import system.io
variable [io.interface]
open nat io

def print_squares : ℕ → io unit
| 0        := return ()
| (succ n) := print_squares n >>
              put_str (nat.to_string n ++ "^2 = " ++ 
                       nat.to_string (n * n) ++ "\n")

#eval print_squares 100
#+END_SRC

We will explain the data type =io unit= in Chapter [[file:07_Monads::#Monads][Monads]]. Although
this program has a real world side effect of sending output to the
screen when run, that effect is invisible to the formal
foundation. From the latter's perspective, the type constructor =io=
and the functions =put_str= and =get_str= are entirely opaque, objects
about which that the axiomatic system has nothing to say. The =print
axioms= command shows that the expression =hello world= depends on the
constants =io= and =put_str=, which have been forcibly added to the
axiomatic system.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import system.io
variable [io.interface]
open io

def hello_world : io unit :=
put_str "hello world\n"

-- BEGIN
#print axioms hello_world
-- END
#+END_SRC
In this way, we can prove properties of programs involving =io= that
do not depend in any way on the particular results of the input and
output.

# At some point, we can mention the possibility of extending Lean with
# other axiomatically declared elements.

** Metaprogramming in Lean
:PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: Metaprogramming_in_Lean
:END:

Lean also allows /metaprograms/, which are Lean programs that involve
objects and constructs that are not part of the axiomatic
foundation. In particular:
- Metaprograms can use arbitrary recursive calls, with no concern for
  termination.
- Metaprograms can access /metaconstants/, that is, primitive
  functions and objects that are implemented internally in Lean and
  are not meant to be trusted by the foundational framework.
Such definitions can be introduced using the keywords =meta def=
instead of =def= and are marked for special treatment. In particular,
because they are not part of the axiomatic foundation, they cannot
appear as part of ordinary Lean definitions and theorems.

For example, the following definition computes McCarthy's 91 function,
without verifying that the computation terminates on all inputs
(though, in fact, it does):
# TODO: change definition of m91 when we can write the recursion 
#       directly
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
meta def m91 : ℕ → ℕ
| n := if n > 100 then n - 10 else m91 (m91 (n + 11))

#eval m91 10
#eval m91 100
#eval m91 1000
#+END_SRC
We can print out the first 120 values of =m91=:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import system.io
variable [io.interface]
open nat io

meta def m91 : ℕ → ℕ
| n := if n > 100 then n - 10 else m91 (m91 (n + 11))

-- BEGIN
meta def print_m91 : ℕ → io unit
| 0        := return ()
| (succ n) := print_m91 n >>
              put_str ("m91 " ++ nat.to_string n ++ " = " ++ 
                       nat.to_string (m91 n) ++ "\n")

#eval print_m91 120
-- END
#+END_SRC
Of course, such uses of recursion are dangerous.
# TODO: replace with meta def foo : nat := foo + 1
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
meta def foo : ℕ → ℕ
| n := foo n + 1

#reduce foo
-- #eval foo 0
#+END_SRC
Evaluating =foo= using the kernel evaluator shows that the
implementation is a bit of a hack; the term in the definition includes
a macro which names =foo= itself. The virtual machine that evaluates
foo goes further, and carries out the recursive call, repeating this
until the process runs out of memory. It is a good thing that Lean
will not allow =foo= to appear in a =theorem= or in an ordinary
=definition=; if we could prove ~foo = foo + 1~ then, substracting
=foo= from both sides, we could prove ~0 = 1~, and hence a
contradiction.

Although metaprograms can be used in various ways, its primary purpose
is to provide a means of extending the functionality of Lean, within
Lean itself. For example, we can use metaprograms to write new
procedures, known as /tactics/, which help us construct proofs. This
next example assumes you are familiar with the notion of a tactic, as
described in /Theorem Proving in Lean/.

The following code implements a tactic that, given any goal,
repeatedly finds a hypothesis =h= of the form =a ∧ b=, and
replaces it by hypotheses (with fresh names) for =a= and =b=.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open tactic monad expr

-- BEGIN
meta def destruct_conjunctions : tactic unit :=
repeat (do
  l ← local_context,
  first $ l^.for (λ h, do
    ht ← infer_type h >>= whnf,
    match ht with
    | `(and %%a %%b) := do
      n ← mk_fresh_name,
      mk_mapp ``and.left [none, none, some h] >>= assertv n a,
      n ← mk_fresh_name,
      mk_mapp ``and.right [none, none, some h] >>= assertv n b,
      clear h
    | _ := failed
    end))
-- END
#+END_SRC
We will explain the details in [[file:08_Writing_Tactics.org::#Writing_Tactics][Chapter 8]] but, roughly speaking, the
code repeats the following action until there is nothing left to do:
get the list of hypotheses in the local context, find a hypothesis =h=
whose type is a conjunction, add new hypotheses justified by =and.left
h= and =and.right h= to the local context, and then delete =h=. We can
then use =destruct_conjunctions= like any other Lean tactic.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open tactic monad expr

meta def destruct_conjunctions : tactic unit :=
repeat (do
  l ← local_context,
  first $ l^.for (λ h, do
    ht ← infer_type h >>= whnf,
    match ht with
    | `(and %%a %%b) := do
      n ← get_unused_name `h none,
      mk_mapp ``and.left [none, none, some h] >>= assertv n a,
      n ← get_unused_name `h none,
      mk_mapp ``and.right [none, none, some h] >>= assertv n b,
      clear h
    | _ := failed
    end))

-- BEGIN
example (a b c : Prop) (h : (a ∧ b) ∧ (c ∧ a)) : c :=
begin destruct_conjunctions >> assumption end
-- END
#+END_SRC
Note that the reason we can use such code to prove theorems without
compromising the integrity of the formal system is that Lean's kernel
always certifies the result. From a foundational point of view, we
don't have to worry about the integrity of the code, only the
integrity of the resulting proofs.

** Overview of the contents

To summarize, we can use Lean in any of the following ways:
- as a programming language
- as a system for verifying properties of programs
- as a system for writing metaprograms, that is, programs that extend
  the functionality of Lean itself

Chapters [[file:02_Programming_Basics.org::#Programming_Basics][2]] to [[file:07_Monads.org::#Monads][7]] explain how to use Lean as a programming language. It
will be helpful if you have some familiarity with the syntax and
meaning of dependent type theory, for example, as presented in
/Theorem Proving in Lean/ (henceforth /TPL/). But, if not, it is
likely that you will be able to pick up the details as we
proceed. Similarly, if you are familiar with functional programming,
you will be able to move through the material more quickly, but we
will try to keep the presentation below self contained.

[[file:04_Verifying_Properties_of_Programs.org::#Verifying_Properties_of_Programs][Chapter 4]] in particular deals with the task of proving things about
programs. Once again, it will be helpful if you are familiar with the
use of Lean as an interactive theorem prover as described in /TPL/,
but if not you are encouraged to forge ahead and refer back to /TPL/
as necessary.

Finally, [[file:08_Writing_Tactics.org::#Writing_Tactics][Chapter 8]] and [[file:09_Writing_Automation.org::#Writing_Automation][Chapter 9]] deal with metaprogramming aspects of
Lean, and, in particular, writing tactics and automation.
