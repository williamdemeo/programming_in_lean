:END:

** A First Look at the Tactic Monad

The canonical way to invoke a tactic in Lean is to use the =by=
keyword within a Lean expression. Suppose we write the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean_text
open tactic

variables a b : Prop

example : a → b → a ∧ b :=
by _
#+END_SRC 
Lean expects something of type =tactic unit= to fill the underscore,
where =tactic= refers to the tactic monad. When the elaborator
processes this definition, it elaborates everything outside the =by=
invocation first (in this case, just the statement of the theorem),
and then calls on the Lean virtual machine to execute the tactic. When
doing so, the virtual machine interprets any axiomatically declared
=meta constant= as references to internal Lean functions that
implement the functionality of the tactic monad.

The tactic monad can be thought of as a combination of a state monad
(where the internal "state" as accessed and acted on by the
=meta constant= primitives) and the option monad. Because it is a
monad, we have the usual =do= notation. So, if =r=, =s=, and =t= are
tactics, you should think of
#+BEGIN_SRC lean_text
do a ← r, 
   b ← s,
   t
#+END_SRC
as meaning "apply tactic =r= to the state, and store the return result
in =a=; apply tactic =s= to the state, and store the return result in
=b=; then, finally, apply tactic =t= to the state." Moreover, any
tactic can /fail/, which is analogous to a return value of =none= in
the option monad. In the example above, if any of =r=, =s=, or =t=
fail, then the compound expression has failed.

There is an additional, really interesting feature of the tactic
monad: it is an /alternative/ monad, in the sense described at the end
of the last chapter. This is used to implement backtracking. If =s=
and =t= are monads, the expression =s <|> t= can be understood as
follows: "do =s=, and if that succeeds, return the corresponding return
value; otherwise, undo any changes to the state that =s= may have
produced, and do =t= instead." This allows us to try =s= and, if it
fails, go on to try =t= as though the first attempt never happened.

When the tactic expression after a =by= is invoked, the tactic wakes
up and says "Whoa! I'm in a monad!" This is just a colorful way of
saying that the virtual machine expects a function that acts on the
tactic state in a certain way, and interprets primitive operations on
the tactic state in terms of functions that are implemented internal
to Lean. At any rate, when it wakes up, it can start to look around
and assess its current state. The goal of this section is to give you
a first look at of some of the things it can do there. Don't worry if
some of the expressions seem mysterious; they will be explained in the
sections that follow.

One thing the tactic can do is print a message to the outside world:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean_text
example : a → b → a ∧ b :=
by do trace "Hi, Mom!"
#+END_SRC
When the file is executed, Lean issues an error message to the effect
that the tactic has failed to fill the relevant placeholder, which is
what it is supposed to do. But the =trace= message is printed during
the execution, providing us with a glimpse of its inner workings. We
can actually trace value of any type that Lean can coerce to a string
output, and we will see that this includes a number of useful types.

Another thing we can do is trace the current tactic state:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean_text
example : a → b → a ∧ b :=
by do trace "Hi, Mom!",
      trace_state
#+END_SRC
Now the output includes the list of /goals/ that are active in the
tactic state, each with a local context that includes the local
variables and hypotheses. In this case there is only one:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean_text
Hi, Mom!
a b : Prop
⊢ a → b → a ∧ b
#+END_SRC
This points to an important fact: the internal, and somewhat
mysterious, tactic state includes at least a list of goals. In fact,
it includes much more: every tactic is invoked in a rich
/environment/ that includes all the objects and declarations that are
present when the tactic is invoked, as well as notations, option
declarations, and so on. In most cases, however, the list of goals is
most directly relevant to the task at hand.

Let us dispense with the trace messages now, and start to prove the
theorem by introducing the first two hypotheses.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean_text
example : a → b → a ∧ b :=
by do eh1 ← intro `h1,
      eh2 ← intro `h2,
      skip
#+END_SRC
The backticks indicate that =h1= and =h2= are /names/; we will discuss
these below. The tactic =skip= is a do-nothing tactic, simply included
to ensure that the resulting expression has type =tactic unit=.

We can now do some looking around. The =meta_constant= called =target=
has type =tactic expr=, and returns the type of the goal. The type
=expr=, like =name=, will be discussed below; it is designed to
reflect the internal representation of Lean expressions, so, roughly,
via meta-programming glue, the =expr= type allows us to manipulate
Lean expressions in Lean itself. In particular, we can ask the tactic
to print the current goal:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean_text
example : a → b → a ∧ b :=
by do eh1 ← intro `h1,
      eh2 ← intro `h2,
      target >>= trace
#+END_SRC
In this case, the output is =a ∧ b=, as we would expect. We can also
ask the tactic to print the elements of the local context.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean_text 
example : a → b → a ∧ b :=
by do eh1 ← intro `h1,
      eh2 ← intro `h2,
      local_context >>= trace
#+END_SRC
This yields the list =[a, b, h1, h2]=. We already happen to have
representations of =h1= and =h2=, because they were returned by the
=intro= tactic. But we can extract the other expressions in the local
context given their names:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean_text 
example : a → b → a ∧ b :=
by do intro `h1,
      intro `h2,
      ea ← get_local `a,
      eb ← get_local `b,
      trace (to_string ea ++ ", " ++ to_string eb),
      skip
#+END_SRC
Notice that =ea= and =eb= are different from =a= and =b=; they have
type =expr= rather than =Prop=. They are the internal representations
of the latter expressions. At present, there is not much for us to do
with these expressions other than print them out, so we will drop them
for now.

In any case, to prove the goal, we can proceed to invoke any of the
Lean's standard tactics. For example, this will work:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open tactic

variables a b : Prop

-- BEGIN
example : a → b → a ∧ b :=
by do intro `h1,
      intro `h2,
      split,
      repeat assumption
-- END
#+END_SRC
We can also do it in a more hands-on way:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open tactic

variables a b : Prop

-- BEGIN
example : a → b → a ∧ b :=
by do eh1 ← intro `h1,
      eh2 ← intro `h2,
      mk_const ``and.intro >>= apply,
      exact eh1,
      exact eh2
-- END
#+END_SRC
The double-backticks will also be explained below, but the general
idea is that the third line of the tactic builds an =expr= that
reflects the =and.intro= declaration in the Lean environment, and
applies it. The =applyc= tactic combines these two steps:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open tactic

variables a b : Prop

-- BEGIN
example : a → b → a ∧ b :=
by do eh1 ← intro `h1,
      eh2 ← intro `h2,
      applyc ``and.intro,
      exact eh1,
      exact eh2
-- END
#+END_SRC
We can also finish the proof as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open tactic

variables a b : Prop

-- BEGIN
example : a → b → a ∧ b :=
by do eh1 ← intro `h1,
      eh2 ← intro `h2,
      e ← to_expr ```(and.intro h1 h2),
      exact e
-- END
#+END_SRC
Here, the construct =```(...)= is used to build a /pre-expression/, the
tactic =to_expr= elaborates it and converts it to an expression, and
the =exact= tactic applies it. In the next section, we will see even
more variations on constructions like these, including tactics that
would enable us to construct the expression =and.intro h1 h2= more
explicitly.

The =do= block in this example has type =tactic unit=, and can be
broken out as an independent tactic.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open tactic

variables a b : Prop

-- BEGIN
meta def my_tactic : tactic unit :=
do eh1 ← intro `h1,
   eh2 ← intro `h2,
   e ← to_expr ``(and.intro %%eh1 %%eh2),
   exact e

example : a → b → a ∧ b :=
by my_tactic
-- END
#+END_SRC
Of course, =my_tactic= is not a very exciting tactic; we designed it
to prove one particular theorem, and it will only work on examples
that have the very same shape. But we can write more intelligent
tactics that inspect the goal, the local hypotheses, and the
environment, and then do more useful things. The mechanism is exactly
the same: we construct an expression of type =tactic unit=, and ask
the virtual machine to execute it at elaboration time to solve the
goal at hand.

** Names and Expressions

Suppose we write an ordinary tactic proof in Lean:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean_text
example (a b : Prop) (h : a ∧ b) : b ∧ a :=
begin
  split,
  exact and.right h,
  exact and.left h
end
#+END_SRC
This way of writing the tactic proof suggests that the =h= in the
tactic block refers to the expression =h : a ∧ b= in the list of
hypotheses. But this is an illusion; what =h= /really/ refers to
is the first hypothesis /named/ =h= that is in the local context of
the goal in the state when the tactic is executed. This is made clear,
for example, by the fact that earlier lines in the proof can change
the name of the hypothesis:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean_text
example (a b : Prop) (h : a ∧ b) : b ∧ a :=
begin
  revert h,
  intro h',
  split,
  exact and.right h',
  exact and.left h'
end
#+END_SRC
Now writing =exact and.right h= would make no sense. We could,
alternatively, contrive to make =h= denote something different from
the original hypothesis. This often happens with the =cases= and
=induction= tactics, which revert hypotheses, peform an action, and
then reintroduce new hypotheses with the same names.

Metaprogramming in Lean requires us to be mindful of and explicit
about the distinction between expressions in the current environment,
like =h : a ∧ b= in the hypothesis of the example, and the Lean
objects that we use to act on the tactic state, such as the name "h"
or an object of type =expr=. Without using the =begin...end= front
end, we can construct the proof as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean_text
open tactic

-- BEGIN
example (a b : Prop) (h : a ∧ b) : b ∧ a :=
by do split,
   to_expr ```(and.right h) >>= exact,
   to_expr ```(and.left h) >>= exact
-- END
#+END_SRC
This tells Lean to elaborate the expressions =and.right h= and
=and.left h= in the context of the current goal, and then apply
them. The =begin...end= construct is essentially a front end that
interprets the proof above in these terms. 

To understand what is going on in situations like this, it is
important to know that Lean's metaprogramming framework provides three
distinct Lean types that are relevant to constructing syntactic
expressions:
- the type =name=, representing /hierarchical names/
- the type =expr=, representing /expressions/
- the type =pexpr=, representing /pre-expressions/
Let us consider each one of them, in turn.

Hierarchical names are denoted in ordinary .lean files with
expressions like =foo.bar.baz= or =nat.mul_comm=. They are used as
identifiers that reference defined constants in Lean, but also for
local variables, attributes, and other objects. Their Lean
representations are defined in =init/meta/name.lean=, together with
some operations that can be performed on them. But for many purposes
we can be oblivious to the details. Whenever we type an expression
that begins with a backtick that is not followed by an open
parenthesis, Lean's parser translates this to the construction of the
associated name. In other words, =`nat.mul_comm= is simply notation
for the compound name with components =nat= and =mul_comm=.

When metaprogramming, we often use names to refer to definitions and
theorems in the Lean environment. In situations like that, it is easy
to make mistakes. In the example below, the tactic definition is
accepted, but its application fails:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open tactic

namespace foo

theorem bar : true := trivial

meta def my_tac : tactic unit :=
mk_const `bar >>= exact

-- example : true := by my_tac -- fails

end foo
#+END_SRC
The problem is that the proper name for the theorem is =foo.bar=
rather than =bar=; if we replace =`bar= by =`foo.bar=, the example is
accepted. The =mk_const= tactic takes an arbitrary name and attempts
to resolve it when the tactic is invoked, so there is no error in the
definition of the tactic. The error is rather that when we wrote
=`bar= we had in mind a particular theorem in the environment at the
time, but we did not identify it correctly. 

For situations like these, Lean provides double-backtick notation. The
following example succeeds:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open tactic

namespace foo

theorem bar : true := trivial

meta def my_tac : tactic unit :=
mk_const ``bar >>= exact

example : true := by my_tac -- fails

end foo
#+END_SRC
It also succeeds if we replace =``bar= by =``foo.bar=. The
double-backtick asks the parser to resolve the expression with the
name of an object in the environment /at parse time/, and insert the
relevant name. This has two advantages:
- if there is no such object in the environment at the time, the
  parser raises an error; and
- assuming it does find the relevant object in the environment, it
  inserts the full name of the object, meaning we can use
  abbreviations that make sense in the context where we are writing
  the tactic.
As a result, it is a good idea to use double-backticks whenever you
want to refer to an existing definition or theorem.

When writing tactics, it is often necessary to generate a fresh
name. You can use =mk_fresh_name= for that:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open tactic

-- BEGIN
example (a : Prop) : a → a :=
by do n ← mk_fresh_name,
      intro n,
      hyp ← get_local n,
      exact hyp
-- END
#+END_SRC 

The type =expr= reflects the internal representation of Lean
expressions. It is defined inductively in the file =expr.lean=, but
when evaluating expressions that involve terms of type =expr=, the
virtual machine uses the internal C++ representations, so each
constructor and the eliminator for the type are translated to the
corresponding C++ functions. Expressions include the sorts =Prop=,
=Type₁=, =Type₂=, ..., constants of each type, applications, lambdas,
Pi types, and let definitions. They also include de Bruijn indices
(with constructor =var=), metavariables, local constants, and macros.

The whole purpose of tactic mode is to construct expressions, and so
this data type is fundamental. We have already seen that the =target=
tactic returns the current goal, which is an expression, and that
=local_context= returns the list of hypotheses that can be used to
solve the current goal, that is, a list of expressions.

Returning to the example at the start of this section, let us consider
ways of constructing the expressions =and.left h= and =and.right h=
more explicitly. The following example uses the =mk_mapp= tactic.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open tactic

-- BEGIN
example (a b : Prop) (h : a ∧ b) : b ∧ a :=
by do split,
   eh ← get_local `h,
   mk_mapp ``and.right [none, none, some eh] >>= exact,
   mk_mapp ``and.left [none, none, some eh] >>= exact
-- END
#+END_SRC
In this example, the invocations of =mk_mapp= retrieve the definition
of =and.right= and =and.left=, respectively. It makes no difference
whether the arguments to those theorems have been marked implicit or
explicit; =mk_mapp= ignores those annotations, and simply applies that
theorem to all the arguments in the subsequent list. Thus the first
argument to =mk_mapp= is a name, while the second argument has type
=list (option expr)=. Each =none= entry in the list tells =mk_mapp= to
treat that argument as implicit and infer it using type inference. In
contrast, an entry of the form =some t= specifies =t= as the
corresponding argument.

The tactic =mk_app= is an even more rudimentary application
builder. It takes the name of the operator, followed by a complete
list of its arguments.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open tactic

-- BEGIN
example (a b : Prop) (h : a ∧ b) : b ∧ a :=
by do split,
      ea ← get_local `a,
      eb ← get_local `b,
      eh ← get_local `h,
      mk_app ``and.right [ea, eb, eh] >>= exact,
      mk_app ``and.left [ea, eb, eh] >>= exact
-- END
#+END_SRC
You can send less than the full list of arguments to =mk_app=, but the
arguments you send are assumed to be the /final/ arguments, with the
earlier ones made implicit. Thus, in the example above, we could send
instead =[eb, eh]= or simply =[eh]=, because the earlier arguments can
be inferred from these.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open tactic

-- BEGIN
example (a b : Prop) (h : a ∧ b) : b ∧ a :=
by do split,
      eh ← get_local `h,
      mk_app ``and.right [eh] >>= exact,
      mk_app ``and.left [eh] >>= exact
-- END
#+END_SRC
Finally, as indicated in the last section, you can also use =mk_const=
to construct a constant expression from the corresponding name:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open tactic

-- BEGIN
example (a b : Prop) (h : a ∧ b) : b ∧ a :=
by do split,
      eh ← get_local `h,
      mk_const ``and.right >>= apply,
      exact eh,
      mk_const ``and.left >>= apply,
      exact eh
-- END
#+END_SRC

We have also seen above that it is possible to use =to_expr= to
elaborate expressions at executation time, in the context of the
current goal.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean_text
open tactic

-- BEGIN
example (a b : Prop) (h : a ∧ b) : b ∧ a :=
by do split,
   to_expr ```(and.right h) >>= exact,
   to_expr ```(and.left h) >>= exact
-- END
#+END_SRC
Here, the expressions =```(and.right h)= and =```(and.left h)= are
pre-expressions, that is, objects of type =pexpr=. The interface to
=pexpr= can be found in the file =pexpr.lean=, but the type is largely
opaque from within Lean. The canonical use is given by the example
above: when Lean's parser encounters an expression of the form
=```(...)=, it constructs the corresponding =pexpr=, which is simply an
internal representation of the unelaborated term. The =to_expr= tactic
then sends that object to the elaborator when the tactic is executed.

Note that the backtick is used in two distinct ways: an expression of
the form =`n=, without the parentheses, denotes a =name=, whereas an
expression of the form =`(...)=, with parentheses, denotes a
=pexpr=. Though this may be confusing at first, it is easy to get used
to the distinction, and the notation is quite convenient.

Lean's pre-expression mechanism also supports the use of
/anti-quotation/, which allows a tactic to tell the elaborator to
insert an expression into a pre-expression at runtime. Returning to
the example above, suppose we are in a situation where instead of the
name =h=, we have the corresponding /expression/, =eh=, and want to
use that to construct the term. We can insert it into the
pre-expression by preceding it with a double-percent sign:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean_text
open tactic

-- BEGIN
example (a b : Prop) (h : a ∧ b) : b ∧ a :=
by do split,
   eh ← get_local `h,
   to_expr ``(and.right %%eh) >>= exact,
   to_expr ``(and.left %%eh) >>= exact
-- END
#+END_SRC
When the tactic is executed, Lean elaborates the pre-expressions given
by =``(...)=, with the expression =eh= inserted in the right
place. The difference between =``(...)= and =```(...)= is that the
first resolves the names contained in the expression when the tactic
is defined, whereas the second resolves them when the tactic is
executed. Since the only name occurring in =and.left %%eh= is
=and.left=, it is better to resolve it right away. However, in the
expression =and.right h= above, =h= only comes into existence when
the tatic is executed, and so we need to use the triple backtick.

[TODO: describe =`(...)=, and improve the explanations]

** Examples

When it comes to writing tactics, you have all the computable entities
of Lean's standard library at your disposal, including lists, natural
numbers, strings, product types, and so on. This makes the tactic
monad a powerful mechanism for writing metaprograms. Some of Lean's
most basic tactics are implemented internally in C++, but many of them
are defined from these in Lean itself.

The entry point for the tactic library is the file
=init/meta/tactic.lean=, where you can find the details of the
interface, and see a number of basic tactics implemented in Lean. For
example, here is the definition of the =assumption= tactic:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open tactic
namespace hide

-- BEGIN
meta def find_same_type : expr → list expr → tactic expr
| e []         := failed
| e (h :: hs) :=
  do t ← infer_type h,
     (unify e t >> return h) <|> find_same_type e hs

meta def assumption : tactic unit :=
do ctx ← local_context,
   t   ← target,
   h   ← find_same_type t ctx,
   exact h
<|> fail "assumption tactic failed"
-- END
end hide
#+END_SRC
The expression =find_same_type t es= tries to find in =es= an
expression with type definitionally equal to =t= in the list of
expressions =es=, by a straightforward recursion on the list. The
=infer_type= tactic calls Lean's internal type inference mechanism to
infer to the type of an expression, and the =unify= tactic (which will
be discussed further in Section [[#Metavariables_and_Unification][Section 8.6]] tries to unify two
expressions, instantiating metavariables if necessary. Note the use of
the =orelse= notation: if the unification fails, the procedure
backtracks and continues to try the remaining elements on the
list. The =fail= tactic announces failure with a given string. The
=failed= tactic simply fails with a generic message, "tactic failed."

One can even manipulate data structures that include tactics
themselves. For example, the =first= tactic takes a list of tactics,
and applies the first one that succeeds:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open tactic

-- BEGIN
meta def first {α : Type} : list (tactic α) → tactic α
| []      := fail "first tactic failed, no more alternatives"
| (t::ts) := t <|> first ts
-- END
#+END_SRC
It fails if none of the tactics on the list succeeds. Consider the
example from [[file:01_Introduction.org::#Metaprogramming_in_Lean][Section 1.4]] of the Introduction:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open tactic monad expr

-- BEGIN
meta def destruct_conjunctions : tactic unit :=
repeat (do
  l ← local_context,
  first $ l.map (λ h, do
    ht ← infer_type h >>= whnf,
    match ht with
    | `(and %%a %%b) := do
      n ← get_unused_name `h none,
      mk_mapp ``and.left [none, none, some h] >>= assertv n a,
      n ← get_unused_name `h none,
      mk_mapp ``and.right [none, none, some h] >>= assertv n b,
      clear h
    | _ := failed
    end))
-- END
#+END_SRC
The =repeat= tactic simply repeats the inner block until it fails. The
inner block starts by getting the local context. The expression
=l.map ...= is just shorthand for =list.map ... l=; it applies the
function in =...= to each element of =l= and returns the resulting
list, in this case a list of tactics. The =first= function then calls
each one sequentially until one of them succeeds. Note the use of the
dollar-sign for function application. In general, an expression =f $
a= denotes nothing more than =f a=, but the binding strength is such
that you do not need to use extra parentheses when =a= is a long
expression. This provides a convenient idiom in situations exactly
like the one in the example.

Some of the elements of the body of the main loop will now be
familiar. For each element =h= of the context, we infer the type of
=h=, and reduce it to weak head normal form. (We will discuss weak
head normal form in the next section.) Assuming the type is an =and=,
we construct the terms =and.left h= and =and.right h= and add them to
the context with a fresh name. The =clear= tactic then deletes =h=
itself.

Remember that when writing =meta defs= you can carry out
arbitrary recursive calls, without any guarantee of termination. You
should use this with caution when writing tactics; if there is any
chance that some unforseen circumstance will result in an infinite
loop, it is wiser to use a large cutoff to prevent the tactic from
hanging. Even the =repeat= tactic is implemented as a finite iteration:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
open tactic nat
namespace hide

-- BEGIN
meta def repeat_at_most : nat → tactic unit → tactic unit
| 0        t := skip
| (succ n) t := (do t, repeat_at_most n t) <|> skip

meta def repeat : tactic unit → tactic unit :=
repeat_at_most 100000
-- END

end hide
#+END_SRC
But 100,000 iterations is still enough to get you into trouble if you
are not careful.

** Reduction 

[This section still under construction. It will discuss the various
types of reduction, the notion of weak head normal form, and the
various transparency settings. It will use some of the examples that follow.]

** Metavariables and Unification
:PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: Metavariables_and_Unification
:END:

[This section is still under construction. It will discuss the notion
of a metavariable and its local context, with the interesting bit of
information that goals in the tactic state are nothing more than
metavariables. So the goal list is really just a list of
metavariables, which can help us make sense of the =get_goals= and
=set_goals= tactics. It will also discuss the =unify= tactic.]
